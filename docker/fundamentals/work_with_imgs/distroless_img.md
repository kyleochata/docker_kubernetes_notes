# Distroless Images

Distroless images are minimal Docker images that contain only the necessary runtime dependencies of applications.

Traditional images include:
- operating sys
- shell utilities
- binaries

Distroless exclude the traditional components, that make it smaller and more secure, but in-turn make it harder to work with.

Advantages:
1. Enhanced Security
- Fewer components in the image means fewer potential vulnerabilities

2. Reduced Image Size
- Smaller image size means faster image pulls and reduced storage requirements

3. Imporved Performance
- Smaller size and fewer components can result in quicker container startup times and lower resource consumption

4. Simplified Compliance and Auditability
- With fewer components, distroless images are easier to audit and verify.

Challenges:
1. No Debugging Tools
- Without shell utilities or debugging tools, troubleshooting issues inside a distroless container is challenging.

2. Dependency Management
- Managing dependencies is more complex, need toensure all required libs are binaries and included in the build process

3. Increased Build Complexity
- Creating distroless images often involves more complex Dockerfiles and build processes

4. Learning Curve
- Knowledge from traditional images is not immediately applicable due to lack of familiar too√üls and different debugging workflow
